# Western USA roadtrip
In summer 2019, we did a roadtrip in Western US. The purpose of this website is to share our quite unusual travel route.

## Summary
We were mostly interested in the south-western national parks (Yosemite, Grand-Canyon, Death Valley) but definitely did not want to miss out on Yellowstone, the greatest and oldest of all nationalparks.
Being constrained by arriving and departing in San Francisco, we realized that our initially planned trip added up to almost 7000km, not really pleasant and feasible in 3 weeks...
Fortunately, [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/home), the american railroad corporation, maintains the [California Zepyhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Zephyr), a daily train that connects SF and Chicago in a stunning, 50-hour-trip.
The insight is that the Zephyr passes through Salt Lake City which serves as an ideal starting point for a road trip into Yellowstone. 

So our roadmap, was to fly to San Francisco, then take a 17-hour-train ride to Salt Lake City (which only cost about 70$ p.P.), then rent a car there (a [Kia Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Soul)), drove it for almost 3 weeks and about 5500km and returned the car in San Francisco.

We camped almost every night, either sleeping in the car or in a tent. Check out the [WikiCamps App](https://usa.wikicamps.co), you can find information and location about campsites there, and also filter for free camping.

We visited the following national parks:

## Day-by-day:

### Day 1: San Francisco - Salt Lake City

Our key trick was to go to SLC by train, because this was the only way to see Yellowstone NP and all south-western NPs in just three weeks. The train ride is an experience on its own, passing through the mountains West of SF (we even saw some snow!) and then the vast desert of Nevada. There are sleeping cars and most importantly, there is a panorama car where the windows are huge and seats are turned towards the windows.  
After a 17-hour-train ride (for about 70$ p.P.) we arrived to Salt Lake City, where we slept a few hours at SLC airport before the actual start of our roadtrip.

### Day 2: Salt Lake City - Alpine

On the first day we hit the road and cover quite some distance to get to the national parks in the north. We shortly stop at **Logan River**, a small river with many fisherman. Then the road winds up the mountain and suddenly we are 2300 meters high, and enjoy a great view of **Bear Lake** from a viewpoint high above the lake. After driving down to the lake and the close-by town **Garden City**, we stop there for picknick and the famous raspberry shakes they sell there. Our route further passes through whole Europe - Montpelier, Geneva, Paris and Bern, before we reach Alpine, the spot of our first campsite. You can drive on a small bumpy road along the southern side of **Palisades Reservoir** and find a spot there right by the lake for free camping.  

### Day 3: Alpine - Rockefeller State Park
