# Western USA roadtrip
In summer 2019, we did a roadtrip in Western US. The purpose of this website is to share our quite unusual travel route.

## Summary
We were mostly interested in the south-western national parks (Yosemite, Grand-Canyon, Death Valley) but definitely did not want to miss out on Yellowstone, the greatest and oldest of all nationalparks.
Being constrained by arriving and departing in San Francisco, we realized that our initially planned trip added up to almost 7000km, not really pleasant and feasible in 3 weeks...
Fortunately, [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/home), the american railroad corporation, maintains the [California Zepyhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Zephyr), a daily train that connects SF and Chicago in a stunning, 50-hour-trip.
The insight is that the Zephyr passes through Salt Lake City which serves as an ideal starting point for a road trip into Yellowstone. 

So our roadmap, was to fly to San Francisco, then take a 17-hour-train ride to Salt Lake City (which only cost about 70$ p.P.), then rent a car there (a [Kia Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Soul)), drove it for almost 3 weeks and about 5500km and returned the car in San Francisco.

We camped almost every night, either sleeping in the car or in a tent. Check out the [WikiCamps App](https://usa.wikicamps.co), you can find information and location about campsites there, and also filter for free camping.

We visited the following national parks:
1. [Grand Teton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton_National_Park)
2. [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park)
3. [Arches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arches_National_Park)
4. [Monument Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley)
5. [Grand Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_National_Park)
6. [Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_National_Park)
7. [Death Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park)
8. [Kings Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Canyon_National_Park)
9. [Yosemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park)

## Day-by-day:

### Day 1: San Francisco - Salt Lake City

Our key trick was to go to SLC by train, because this was the only way to see Yellowstone NP and all south-western NPs in just three weeks. The train ride is an experience on its own, passing through the mountains West of SF (we even saw some snow!) and then the vast desert of Nevada. There are sleeping cars and most importantly, there is a panorama car where the windows are huge and seats are turned towards the windows.  
After a 17-hour-train ride (for about 70$ p.P.) we arrived to Salt Lake City, where we slept a few hours at SLC airport before the actual start of our roadtrip.

### Day 2: Salt Lake City - Alpine

On the first day we hit the road and cover quite some distance to get to the national parks in the north. We shortly stop at **Logan River**, a small river with many fisherman. Then the road winds up the mountain and suddenly we are 2300 meters high, and enjoy a great view of **Bear Lake** from a viewpoint high above the lake. After driving down to the lake and the close-by town **Garden City**, we stop there for picknick and the famous raspberry shakes they sell there. Our route further passes through whole Europe - Montpelier, Geneva, Paris and Bern, before we reach Alpine, the spot of our first campsite. You can drive on a small bumpy road along the southern side of **Palisades Reservoir** and find a spot there right by the lake for free camping.  

### Day 3: Alpine - Rockefeller State Park

Wyoming appeared to us as the state closest to all Wild Western movies. In **Jackson**, half of the shops are made for Cowboys, with a large collection of cowboy hats and lots of gear, for example bear spray which is recommended to carry on the trip further to the north. In Jackson there is also a park with gates made of antlers. 

After Jackson we reach the first national park on our trip, **Grand Teton**. The drive itself is amazing, crossing the plateau with snowy mountains on the side. There are several nice hikes, for example we walked to **Bradley and Taggart Lake**. We visited in June and it was still very snowy, but if it is possible, it would probably be a great tour to walk up **Paintbrush Canyon** and back through **Cascade Canyon**. We left Grand Teton and camped right outside in Rockefeller State Park, there is a parking lot close to a lake were several people parked their cars and campervans.

### Day 4: Rockefeller State Park - Yellowstone NP West Entrance

Although Grand Teton was impressive, **Yellowstone** is a different level because there are not many vulcanic areas in the world that you can visit. For example, Yellowstone is one out of four places in the world with active geysires. Most importantly, Old Faithful geysir erupts quite regularly every 90 minutes in is spectaculous. For the drive through the park you should plan some time, because there is stops every few kilometers with hot springs, bubbling mud pools, geysires and lakes. 

We drove west on the 8-shaped loop, and visited **Old Faithful**, **Grand Prismatic Springs**, **Biscuit Basin** and **Lower Geysir Basin**. We also did a 2h hike to **Fairy Falls* where you can get a beautiful view on the whole park, with dense forests interrupted by volcanic areas. In the evening we camped on Madison campground. Note that you have to reserve around one day in advance (and during holidays probably more). 

### Day 5  Yellowstone NP West - Yellowstone East

Apart from volcanic formations, a main attraction in Yellowstone are the animals. We saw a lot more of them in the northern part of the loop drive, starting with some bisons and Waipiti, and one wolves on this day. We had breakfast at **Norris Geysir Basin** with the **Steamboat Geysir**, and after some smaller stops we reached the north entrance of the park. Even after seeing lots of hot springs until then, we are amazed by the **Mammoth Hot Springs** which stand out because of their terrace formations, building cascades of colourful waterfalls. 

We shortly left the park through the north entrance for a visit to Montana and the city **Gardiner**, where we were back to civilization for a bit (there is hardly any mobile network connection in the park). Continuing our ride through the park, we were lucky to see a couple of **black bears** close to the **Petrified tree**. In the evening we climbed down a track at the **Tower Falls** to a nice little riverside place. We camped not far from the East Entrance at **Canyon Campground**.

### Day 6: Yellowstone East - Cody

Before leaving Yellowstone, we visit its last attraction, the **Grand Canyon of Yellowstone**. Although not comparible in size with the real Grand Canyon, it offers amazing views of beautiful waterfalls on sand-coloured rocks. We took a round trip track of around 2h along the Canyon and then back through forests and along lakes, where it can happen that suddenly there is a bubbling mud pool to the side of the path.

At east entrance some bisons watch from the side of the road how we are leaving Yellowstone and head towards **Cody**, the 'Capital of Rodeo'. When planning our trip, we considered going back to the south via Jackson again, because driving through Cody and Thermopolis adds quite a few kilometers, but in the end we decided for Cody because we wanted to see some more of Wyoming. Our hopes were fulfilled - In Cody we felt like in a Western movie. In the evening we went to see a **rodeo** in its most authentic version, and afterwards we went to Buffalo Bill Bar, had a Whiskey and talked to one of the bull riders. Coming from Europe, Cody is as clich√© wild west as it can get.

### Day 7: Cody - Green River

Although it is rather a road trip day with a long distance, we get to see several unusual sights on the way. First, we stop in **Thermopolis**, which demonstrates the vastness of the vulcanic area in Wyoming with some more hot pools. The secret tip there is to use the free public baths with water heated from geothermal energy (we appreciated that a lot after camping and bathing in lakes for a few days). Secondly, we take a short detour from **Lander**, a town at the edge of **Wind River Reservation**, a huge Indian reservate. A 20 minutes drive takes us to **Sinks Canyon State Park** which has a truly fascinating sight: At one point in the park, a river vanishes underground, to re-appear a few hundred meters further out of nowhere. It has only been shown by colouring the water that both are connected, but no ones knows the path the water takes underground.

Last, we stop in South Pass City, a ghost town. You can stroll through the street in the evening on your own, reading about the gold rush, or take a guided tour during the day. Finally our trip takes us to **Green River** where we were lucky to visit a random party of ''Flaming Gorge Days'' and dance with some teenagers.
