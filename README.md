# Western USA roadtrip
In summer 2019, we did a roadtrip in Western US. The purpose of this website is to share our quite unusual travel route.

## The summary
We were mostly interested in the south-western national parks (Yosemite, Grand-Canyon, Death Valley) but definitely did not want to miss out on Yellowstone, the greatest and oldest of all nationalparks.
Being constrained by arriving and departing in San Francisco, we realized that our initially planned trip added up to more than 6000km, not really pleasant and feasible in 3 weeks...
Fortunately, [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/home), the american railroad corporation, maintains the [California Zepyhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Zephyr), a daily train that connects SF and Chicago in a stunning, 50-hour-trip.
The insight is that the Zephyr passes through Salt Lake City which serves as an ideal starting point for a road trip into Yellowstone. 

So our roadmap, was to fly to San Francisco, then take a 17-hour-train ride to Salt Lake City (which only cost about 70$ p.P.), then rent a car there (a [Kia Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Soul)), drove it for almost 3 weeks and ~3000 miles and returned the car in San Francisco.

We visited the following national parks:
